# Smart Contract Interactor

A simple smart contract interactor using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), inspired by [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) contract interactor.

# Note

This site is using [metamask-react](https://github.com/VGLoic/metamask-react/) to interact with MetaMask.
But it is included as a vendor library instead of using `yarn`/`npm` because it is incompatible with node 16.
